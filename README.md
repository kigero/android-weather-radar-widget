Weather Radar Widget
A super simple widget that does nothing but display weather radar as a widget on your home screen.  Well, it does one other thing - if you tap on it Radar Express opens up.

I don't plan on supporting or extending this, it does what I want it to, so I thought I would upload it to github for posterity.

To use the pom file, you'll need maven v3.1.1+.
